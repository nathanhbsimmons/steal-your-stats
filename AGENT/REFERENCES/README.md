# UI Design References — Steal Your Stats

This folder contains **style reference screenshots** used only for *look & feel guidance*.  
They are not to be copied literally into the app — the **STYLE_GUIDE.md** defines the actual design tokens and components.  

Cursor should use these screenshots only to approximate **aesthetic language** (retro/monochrome, borders, shadows, typography vibe).  
All actual content, icons, and copy come from the application requirements — **not** from these screenshots.

## Files

- `screenshot-01.jpg`  
  *Reference for retro window chrome and split layout: sidebar with folders on the left, main content on the right. Demonstrates thick borders, rounded corners, striped header bar, and offset shadow.*

- `screenshot-02.jpg`  
  *Reference for minimal app icon grid inside a retro window. Shows how to style outlined icons, consistent spacing, and monochrome treatment.*

- `screenshot-03.jpg`  
  *Reference for system-info style window: centered content, bordered panels, progress/memory bar, and a clean typographic hierarchy. Captures the retro OS parody look (“Rafindows 95”).*

## Usage Notes

- Screenshots are **not source of truth** — style tokens in `/AGENT/STYLE_GUIDE.md` are.  
- Use screenshots to check general proportions, spacing, and retro vibe.  
- Do not replicate logos, text labels, or app-specific icons from these references.  
- When in doubt, favor the written style rules over the image.
